# comparison-of-SVM-and-MNB-using-Opinion-Mining
In this project, the accuracies and efficiency of two classification algorithms named as- Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Multinomial Naive Bayes(MNB) has been compared by using a Natural Language Processing(NLP) technique- Opinion Mining(also known as, Sentiment Analysis). This was performed on a twitter dataset containing more than 1.5 Million tweets. The datset was downloaded from KaggleInc.
